# RandomBreaker

This was a class I wrote for a project in high school and recently updated for a presentation at [UTD CSG](https://csg.utdallas.edu/).

`RandomTester.java` will test the `RandomBreaker` class on random consecutive outputs from `nextInt()`.

What still needs to be done:
- Generate seeds where multiple possible states are found to make sure the state elimination part of the code works
- Clean up `RandomBreaker` class and potentially add state elimination in.
